/**
 * This package contains all controllers for the NoticeMenuGUI application.
 * 
 * Each controller is responsible for managing a specific screen in the 
 * application and handling user interactions on that screen. Controllers 
 * interact with the model classes to retrieve and manipulate data, and 
 * they also facilitate navigation between different views.
 * 
 * controller.AddNoticeScreenController - Manages the "Add Notice" screen, allowing users to create and submit new notices.
 * controller.LoginScreenController - Manages the login screen, handling user authentication.
 * controller.TableScreenController - Manages the main table view, displaying all notices and allowing users to view, delete, or add notices.
 * 
 * These controllers rely on the model.User and model.NoticeList
 * classes for managing application state and providing data to the views.
