# Resources Directory

This directory contains all the FXML files and other resources for the NoticeMenuGUI application.

## FXML Files
Each FXML file corresponds to a different screen in the application, including:
- `LoginScreen.fxml` - The login screen layout.
- `AddNoticeScreen.fxml` - The layout for adding new notices.
- `TableScreen.fxml` - The main table layout displaying all notices.

These files define the structure and components for each screen, with controllers in the `controller` package managing their behavior.
